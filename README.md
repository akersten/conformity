# conformity
A plaintext linter; fixed column width formatter and reflower

## What is conformity?

Conformity is an interactive column length wrapper (think `gq` in vim). It can
operate in two modes, one that preserves existing line breaks (reflowing) and
 one that compacts whitespace (minifying).
